Basic Info:
===========

This is an air hockey game that can be changed between multiple themes and paddle shapes. It keeps track of players' scores and the game ends whenever a player reaches 7 points. The game can be played when in the 3 preset views, but in order to rotate the camera freely, it must be in the paused state.

To compile: Run "make" in the "build" directory - this builds the executable. 

To run: Switch into the "bin" directory and type "./air_hockey" - no other command line arguments needed.

To recompile: Run "make clean" in the "build" directory followed by "make".
